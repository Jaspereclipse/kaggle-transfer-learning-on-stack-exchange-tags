# Project Name

Predicting topics of Stack Exchange questions based on the context.

## Overview

This project compares different features (tf-idf, doc2vec) and different classification models (Naive Bayes, SVM) in the task of predicting related topic for questions being asked in the Stack Exchange communities.

I implemented my own version of doc2vec model in [TensorFlow r0.12](https://www.tensorflow.org/) mimicing the word2vec example in TensorFlow's [tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/tutorials/embedding/word2vec.py).
